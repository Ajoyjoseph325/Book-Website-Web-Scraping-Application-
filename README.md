## Overview

The **Book Website Web Scraping Application** is a Python-based tool designed to extract critical data from a specified book retailer or review website. The application utilizes several powerful Python libraries, including **Pandas**, **Regex**, and **BeautifulSoup**, to scrape and process book-related information, such as titles, authors, prices, ratings, and reviews.

This application can be customized to work with different websites, making it a versatile tool for gathering data from online book retailers and review platforms.

## Features

- Extract key information such as:
  - Book title
  - Author
  - Price
  - Rating
  - Reviews
- Store scraped data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- Easily configurable to work with different book websites.

## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `requests` – To make HTTP requests and fetch webpage content.
- `beautifulsoup4` – To parse and navigate the HTML content.
- `pandas` – To organize and store the scraped data.
- `re` – Regular expressions for data cleaning and extraction.

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.

3. Modify the `scraper.py` file to include the URL of the website you want to scrape.

4. Run the script using Python:
